## Features

### Sorting Algorithms
- Visualize the sorting process of algorithms through *Books* in a library, aiming to sort all books alphabetically.
- Users can select the desired algorithm for visualization, adjust the speed of the visualization, specify the number of books, and simulate the worst-case scenario.
- **Algorithms supported**: 
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Quick Sort

### Path Finding Algorithms
- Visualize the pathfinding process through a drawable *Maze*.
- Users are provided with a blank canvas to draw the maze, set the start and end points, and visualize the pathfinding process.
- Users can choose the desired algorithm for visualization and adjust the speed of the animation.
- **Algorithms supported**: 
  - Depth First Search
  - Breadth First Search

## Pre-requisites
This project is built using:
- Pure HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up TypeScript:

1. **Install TypeScript Globally**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
2 **Install HTTP Server** (Optional for local hosting):
npm install -g http-server

**How to Run**
Compile TypeScript: Open your command line interface and navigate to the project directory, then run:
tsc --watch
Note: This command will automatically compile TypeScript files into JavaScript every time you save changes.

Start the Server (Optional): If you installed HTTP server, you can run:
http-server


Thank you for checking out the Algorithms Visualizer! Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of algorithms.
